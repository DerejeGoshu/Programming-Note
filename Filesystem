Differences between the NTFS and FAT32 memory card file systems
Applicable products：Tablet，Smartphone
Most commercially available memory cards use the FAT32 file system by default. NTFS and FAT32 file systems differ in the following ways:

The FAT32 file system cannot store individual files larger than 4 GB, while the NTFS file system can.
Compared to FAT32, the NTFS file system has higher disk utilization and can manage disk space more effectively.
The read and write speeds of NTFS are also faster than that of FAT32.
The FAT32 file system is suitable for smaller capacity flash memory devices (such as memory cards, USB drives, and other storage devices), while the NTFS file system is suitable for large capacity disks.
